            <p>Frogs belong to the Order Anura, the largest of the three groups of amphibians. There are three groups of
                amphibians. Newts and salamanders (Order Caudata), Caecilians (Order Gymnopiona), and frogs and toads
                (Order Anura). Frogs and toads, also referred to as anurans, represent the largest of the three
                amphibian groups. Of the approximately 6,000 species of amphibians, about 4,380 belong to the Order
                Anura.</p>
